		RTF Processor V 0.8 (alpha)

The RTF package set is a minimal RTF processor.
This set is provided with an RTF to HTML converter.
This converter is just an example not a full-fledged application

You can try this converter on replicas.rtf
(<http://www.research.microsoft.com/~gray/replicas.rtf>) or on the RTF
specification (see "ressources"). For example:

	% rtf2html.pl corpus/replicas.rtf > replicas.htm
